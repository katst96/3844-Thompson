##  What is a VT Shaped Student

A reflection of the VT Shaped Student from a VT Student 



### Introduction

I am writing this website as a VT student with a rather atypical experience at VT. After fall semester of 2016, I was granted academic relief and was not enrolled as a student during the spring 2017 semester. I still chose to live in Blacksburg during this time and maintained a part-time job.

My experience with digital writing is next to none. I did one small assignment using very basic html code back in spring 2016 for another english class, but I had a classmate do all the dirty work for me. I simply refuse to learn any computer programming skills through the english department. I understand having such skills could potentially make me a more attractive candidate for a job position in the future, but the english department's pathetic attempt to have their students aquire such skills through this class is commical.

# My Thoughts on the VT Shaped Student 

I think the concept of the VT Shaped Student is characteristic of the school as a whole, but I had not actually heard of the concept until this class. It's clearly all for publicity and PR if you ask me. 

## Interests

1. Rugby 
2. Motorcycles 
3. Watching sunsets 
4. My dog Bennett 

None of my interests have anything to do with digital writing or what I see as the work of a VT Shaped Student. None of my interests deal with the V or the T of the VT Shaped Student. 

### The Vertical Component 

The vertical component of the VT Shaped Student is described as having deep knowledge of a discipline or a major. I agree this is rightfully the backbone of any college student. 

## The Horizontal Component 

I think the the Horizontal component is very broad but the ideas are decent. I'm not sure if people necessarily think about solving big problems related to their major when studying a major, especially as an undergraduate. I also feel the options are very limited on the admissions website, which ultimately limits the choices of majors you have to choose from in the vertical component. 

## The V Component

The learn by doing idea is good but again I think it is too broad and far from sincere. 

## Plans and Goals 

I have no plans or goals regarding the VT Shaped Student. My own personal plans consist of finishing school and getting a job in the design of written content. 

## Recommendations

My recommendation to incoming freshmen would be to get involved in as many clubs and organizations possible. Most would encourage freshmen to focus on their studies but your first year at VT is vital for getting involved.
