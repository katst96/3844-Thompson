##  What is a VT Shaped Student

A reflection of the VT Shaped Student from a VT Student 



### Introduction

I am writing this website as a VT student with a rather atypical experience at VT. After fall semester of 2016, I was granted academic relief and was not enrolled as a student during the spring 2017 semester. I still chose to live in Blacksburg during this time and maintained a part-time job.

My experience with digital writing is next to none. I did one small assignment using very basic html code back in spring 2016 for another english class, but I had a classmate do all the dirty work for me. I simply refuse to learn any computer programming skills through the english department. I understand having such skills could potentially make me a more attractive candidate for a job position in the future, but the english department's pathetic attempt to have their students aquire such skills through this class is commical.
